# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```
# NFT Minting Platform Documentation
# Overview
This platform enables users to mint NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). It allows creators to reward 
collectors with their custom tokens or offer utility, such as exclusive access to content or 
governance features. The platform supports wallet integration for seamless transactions and 
features decentralized storage for media files.
Key Features
1. NFT Minting
 User Flow: 
o Users upload media files (images, audio, video) to create NFTs.
o Metadata customization allows users to add traits like name, description, and 
attributes.
o The user clicks "Mint," and the NFT is minted on the blockchain.
o The minted NFT appears in the user's connected wallet.
.
2. Metadata Customization for NFTs
 Users can set detailed metadata for each NFT: 
o Name
o Description
o Attributes (e.g., rarity, traits, categories)
o Image (stored on decentralized storage like IPFS or Arweave)
3. Wallet Integration
 Users can connect their crypto wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect) to mint and manage 
NFTs and tokens.
 Wallets enable users to store NFTs, view custom tokens, and perform transactions such 
as minting and selling.
4. Token-NFT Utility
 Custom tokens can be linked to specific NFT utilities. 
o Exclusive Content Access: NFT holders can use custom tokens to unlock
exclusive content.
o Rewards: NFT holders can be rewarded with the custom token for holding or 
interacting with the NFT.
o Governance: Tokens can be used to vote on platform governance decisions.
5. Marketplace Integration (Optional)
 A marketplace allows users to buy, sell, and trade NFTs minted on the platform.
 NFTs can be listed with their associated metadata, and users can use the platform's 
custom tokens for transactions.
Tech Stack
1. Blockchain
 Ethereum or Polygon for minting NFTs and tokens. 
o Ethereum: Widely used blockchain for NFTs with robust ecosystem and support.
o Polygon: Layer 2 solution for Ethereum that offers lower gas fees, making it ideal 
for projects with frequent minting and transactions.
2. Smart Contracts
 NFT Smart Contracts: 
o ERC-721 or ERC-1155 for minting NFTs. 
 ERC-721: Standard for unique, one-of-a-kind NFTs.
 ERC-1155: Multi-token standard for minting both fungible and nonfungible tokens.
 Token Smart Contracts: 
o ERC-20 for minting fungible tokens. 
 Allows the creation of custom tokens with properties like supply cap, 
decimals, and minting functions.
3. Frontend
 React.js for building the user interface. 
o React.js: A popular JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
4. Storage
 IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) or Arweave for decentralized media storage. 
o IPFS: A peer-to-peer file storage protocol that ensures the permanence of media 
files.
o Arweave: A blockchain-based storage solution that offers perpetual data storage 
with a one-time fee.
5. Blockchain Interaction
 Alchemy, Infura, or Pinata for interacting with the Ethereum or Polygon network. 
o Alchemy: A developer platform that provides infrastructure for building 
decentralized applications (dApps).
o Infura: A platform offering scalable and reliable Ethereum and IPFS access for 
developers.
o Pinata: A platform for managing files stored on IPFS, with added features for 
media file pinning.
6. Token-NFT Utility
 Smart Contract Logic to integrate token and NFT utilities (e.g., token airdrops, rewards 
for NFT holders, content unlocking).
 Governance Features: Implement a voting mechanism where token holders can vote on 
platform proposals.
Example Flow
#  NFT Minting Process
1. User Uploads Media: 
o The user uploads a media file (image, video, or audio).
o The file is stored on IPFS or Arweave, and the IPFS/Arweave URL is saved in the 
NFT's metadata.
2. Metadata Customization: 
o The user customizes metadata like the name, description, and traits (e.g., rarity, 
artist).
3. Minting the NFT: 
o The user clicks the "Mint" button, triggering the minting of the NFT on the 
blockchain (using ERC-721 or ERC-1155).
o The NFT is minted and the transaction is recorded on Ethereum or Polygon.
4. NFT Stored in Wallet: 
o The minted NFT is transferred to the user’s connected wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
# Token-NFT Utility Integration
 Exclusive Content: 
o NFT holders can use custom tokens to unlock exclusive content, such as 
downloadable files or access to premium videos.
 Rewards: 
o The platform can automatically distribute custom tokens to NFT holders as a 
reward for actions like sharing, interacting with NFTs, or participating in a 
governance vote.
 Governance: 
o Custom tokens can be used to participate in governance features, like voting on 
new features or platform updates.
